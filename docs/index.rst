   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ListenBrainz' API documentation!
===========================================

:doc:`Information for developers <dev/api>` who want to use our API to submit and fetch listens. We suggest taking
a look the the :doc:`json <dev/json>` documentation, since most of the complexity in using the API comes from constructing/reading
the ListenBrainz JSON documents.
